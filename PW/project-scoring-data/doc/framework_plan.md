# Introduction 

*Why was the study undertaken? What was the research question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research?*

Purposes of the research: 

1. Find and describe relations in the data (relations bewteen explanatory variables and response variable, relations bewteen explanatory variables). 

2. Build a classification model, with the use of different approaches, e.g.:

  - Logistic Regression Model
  - Discriminant Analysis (Linear, Quadratic)
  - Tree-Based Methods (Decision Tree, Conditional Regression Tree, Random Forests)

4. Compare model performance metrics:

  - @TODO: complete 

with results randomness taken into consideration. 

3. Compare model performance in terms of profit, based on cost-matrix values.  





# Methods

*When, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was included in the study groups (patients, etc.)?*


## Data formattng

- recoding selected variables, saving as factor
- changing variables type from int to num
- recoding response variable
- renaming columns


## Data pre-processing 

- search for detecting missing, corrupt and invalid data (basic summaries, graphical tools)
- creating derived variables
- binning countinuous variables
- correcting bins (levels) of categorical variables (combining levels if needed)
- recoding variables to WoE

Also:

- visualizations of IV of variables binned in different ways 
- visualizations of IV of binned variables, WoE of selected binned variables 



## Models Building 

### Logistic regression (scoring) model 

- [@TODO] feature selection 
- [@TODO] simple modelling
- [@TODO] model performance measures  
- [@TODO] cost-sensitive modelling (comparision of different approaches)



### [@TODO] others 





# Results

*What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true?*





# Discussion

*What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research?*
